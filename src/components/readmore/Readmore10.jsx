          Wachemo University and Werabe University have formalized their
          commitment to preserving the Silte language through a Memorandum of
          Understanding (MoU) signing. This collaborative effort aims to
          document and digitize the Silte language by developing a range of
          educational resources, including multilingual self-study guidebooks,
          online courses, mobile applications, and audio pronunciation tools. By
          leveraging their collective expertise and resources, both universities
          are dedicated to ensuring the accessibility and sustainability of the
          Silte language for future generations.
