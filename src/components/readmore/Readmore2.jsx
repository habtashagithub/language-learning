          As soon the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between
          Wachemo University and the Culture and Tourism Office of the Central
          Ethiopia Regional State, an essential preparatory step involved the
          translation of Kabena Language. Spearheading this endeavor was Mr.
          Abdulwase Mohamed, the Head of Kabena Special Woreda’s Culture and
          Tourism Office, who appointed a team of four translators for the task.
          The appointed translators included Ato Muze Hussain, Mr. Hadi Diga,
          Mr. Jilalu Fadlu, and Ms. Ramzia Shemsu, all tasked with the
          responsibility of translating the language in line with predetermined
          statements in both English and Amharic.
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure accuracy and adherence to predetermined standards, the core
          team from Ethio Language Box played a pivotal role in training the
          translators. Led by Dr. Sekhar, alongside Assistant Professor Eyasu
          Tilahun and Mr. Habtemariam, the training sessions provided
          comprehensive guidance on the translation process. Through these
          sessions, translators were equipped with the necessary skills and
          knowledge to effectively translate Kabena Language while maintaining
          consistency with the predetermined statements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The translation phase, spanning from April 22 to 27, 2024, marked a
          significant milestone in the collaboration between Wachemo University
          and the Culture and Tourism Office of the Central Ethiopia Regional
          State. With meticulous attention to detail and professional expertise,
          the translators diligently carried out their task, ensuring that the
          translated content accurately represented the cultural nuances and
          linguistic intricacies of Kabena Language. This collaborative effort
          underscores the commitment to promoting cultural preservation and
          facilitating meaningful communication within the region.
