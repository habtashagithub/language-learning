          documentation and digitization of Mareko, Kabena, and Gurage
          languages, leveraging self-study guidebooks, mobile applications,
          online courses, and audio pronunciation tools. Dr. Habtamu Abebe,
          President of Wachemo University, highlighted the institution’s track
          record in documenting various Ethiopian languages and reiterated their
          commitment to completing the remaining languages in the Central
          Ethiopia Region, positioning it as the first region in Ethiopia to
          achieve such comprehensive digitization. Mr. Samuel Mengesha, Head of

          The Ethio Language Box core team, comprising Dr. K. Sekhar, Mr. Eyasu
          Tilahun, and Mr. Habtemariam, presented the project’s objectives of
          facilitating language learning through familiar Ethiopian languages or
          English, distributing informational materials, and showcasing the
          project’s technological infrastructure for documentation and
          digitization. The initiative aims to provide accessible learning
          resources through self-study guides, mobile applications available on
          the Google Play Store, online courses via the website
          https://ethiolanguagebox.com/, and audio pronunciation tools,
          fostering the preservation and exploration of Ethiopia’s linguistic
          diversity.
